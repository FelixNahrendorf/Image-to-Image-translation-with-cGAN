This project aims to study Conditional Adversarial Networks for Image to Image Translation and Image Generation tasks. It is based on the results from the paper: P. Isola, J.-Y. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. A. Efros. Image-to-image translation with conditional
adversarial networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern
recognition, pages 1125–1134, 2017.

The paper is accessible here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320966887_Image-to-Image_Translation_with_Conditional_Adversarial_Networks

The project is being done during my studies at TU Berlin in the Course "Machine Learning Project" offered by The Machine Learning Group at TU Berlin chaired by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller.
